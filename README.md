# 📚 Marxists Library Web Scraper

A modern, client-side web scraping tool that extracts, processes, and visualizes author data from the Portuguese section of the [Marxists Internet Archive](https://www.marxists.org/portugues/biblioteca.htm).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform **web scraping** directly from the browser using Vanilla JavaScript. It fetches the raw HTML from an external website, parses the DOM to extract specific information (author names), and presents it in a clean, responsive user interface.

### Key Features
*   **Live Scraping:** Fetches real-time data from the source.
*   **CORS Bypass:** Uses a proxy (AllOrigins) to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing restrictions.
*   **Data Visualization:** Displays statistics (authors per letter) and a complete list.
*   **Search Filter:** Real-time filtering of authors by name.
*   **Modern UI:** Styled with CSS3, Grid, and Flexbox.
